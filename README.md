Reversi Board Game, coded in Java.

Short explanation:

The game Reversi, also known as Othello, is a strategy board game for two players. The objective of the game is to have the majority of your colored discs on the board at the end of the game.
The game is played on an 8x8 square board, with each player assigned a color.
The game starts with four discs in the center of the board, two of each color, arranged diagonally. 
Players take turns placing one disc at a time on the board, with their color facing up.
The key mechanic of Reversi is that when a player places a disc, any opponent discs that are sandwiched between the newly placed disc and any discs of the player's color already on the board are flipped over, 
changing their color to the player's color. The player must make a move that captures at least one of the opponent's discs. If a player cannot make a valid move, they pass their turn.
